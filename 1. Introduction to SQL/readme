Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables called relational databases. Being able to wrangle and extract data from these databases using SQL is an essential skill within the data industry and in increasing demand.

In this two-hour introduction to SQL, you'll get to know the theory and the practice through bite-sized videos and interactive exercises where you can put your new-found skills to the test.

SQL is an essential language for building and maintaining relational databases, which opens the door to a range of careers in the data industry and beyond. You’ll start this course by covering data organization, tables, and best practices for database construction.

The second half of this course looks at creating SQL queries for selecting data that you need from your database. You’ll have the chance to practice your querying skills before moving on to customizing and saving your results.

PostgreSQL and SQL Server are two of the most popular SQL flavors. You’ll finish off this course by looking at the differences, benefits, and applications of each. By the end of the course you’ll have some hands-on experience in learning SQL and the grounding to start applying it on projects or continue your learning in a more specialized direction.
